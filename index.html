            Hi there! I'm a student of computer engineering with a passion for
            web development. As a self-taught web developer, I have gained
            experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, etc. I am constantly
            learning and exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with the
            latest advancements in the field. Through my portfolio, I aim to
            showcase my projects and demonstrate my ability to create
            user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing websites. From
            previous project , you will see my attention to detail,
            problem-solving skills, and ability to turn design concepts into
            reality. I am eager to bring my passion and skills to a professional
            environment and am excited about the opportunity to learn and grow
            as a web developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope

            <h3>Student Grade Tracking System</h3>
            <p>
              This project was developed by a team of students to help teachers
              keep track of students' grades and performance. The system allows
              teachers to input grades, generate reports, and communicate with
              students. The user-friendly interface and the ability to access
              grades from anywhere make it an indispensable tool for teachers.

            <h3>Campus Event Management System</h3>
            <p>
              This project was developed by a group of students as a solution
              for managing events on campus. The system allows students and
              staff to create, promote, and manage events. It also has features
              for scheduling and organizing events, as well as sending out
              reminders to attendees. The system streamlines event management,

              customers with local restaurants, allowing them to order food for
              delivery or pickup. It includes features such as menu management,
